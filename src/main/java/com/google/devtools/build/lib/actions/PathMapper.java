/**
 * Support for mapping config parts of exec paths in an action's command line as well as when

 * <p>Actions that want to support path mapping should use {@link
 * com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.PathMappers}.
 *
 * <p>An example of an implementing class is {@link
 * com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.StrippingPathMapper}, which removes the config
 * part (e.g. "k8-fastbuild") from exec paths to allow for cross-configuration cache hits.

   * custom command lines that are evaluated during the execution phase.
   *
   * <p>Since any unmapped path appearing in a command line will prevent cross-configuration cache
   * hits, this mapping is applied automatically instead of requiring users to explicitly map all
   * paths themselves. As an added benefit, this allows actions to opt into path mapping without
   * actual changes to their command line code.
